  Perfect 2023 opening book's release notes:
• Based on various short opening lines, played only same PCs (in SCCT tours)
  For example, as hardweres are used: 2x E5-2686 plus on 2x Epyc 7B12 as well
• Each opening is carefully hand tuned (it's highly optimized for eng matches)
• The winning percentage of mostly openings (average): Whites 52% / Blacks 48%
• These perc. values are based on close in strength NNUE engines (3700+ Elo)
• Book’s Depth is mainly up to 8 moves (exc.a few lines are slightly deeper…)
• Includes very strong openings, recommended as same book for all engines
• I've spent more than 20 years for the optimization over the current openings
• Mostly opening lines are tested over than 1.000.000 SCCT games (since 2002)
• For Book Options (ABK, BIN, BKT, CTG) please check the Settings folder…

And without to not mention this I can't (about testings 3500+ Elo):
Via Perfect 2023 book is not required thousands of games (per player)
For example, minus plus 800 - 1000 games is enough for determining…
Plus it is not required e.g testing each opening as twice… where via weak
Openings are highly suggested thousands games / repeating as twice…

On other hand (via latest Perfect opening book):
If NNUE 3700+ tours, it's expecting higher draws, but this is as 'key' that
Perfect 2023 book has no much holes, I mean like NNUE 3700+ engines!
Ok… that's all for now… enjoy and happy testings !)
